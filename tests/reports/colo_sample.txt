INDICATIONS FOR EXAMINATION:      Screening Colonoscopy.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:             COLONOSCOPY - screening, average risk
COLONOSCOPY - cold biopsy

MEDICATIONS:    MAC anesthesia

PROCEDURE TECHNIQUE:
Informed consent obtained for the procedure including risks, benefits and alternatives and the risk of those alternatives. Informed consent obtained for sedation including risks, benefits and alternatives and the risk of those alternatives. Pulse, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure were monitored throughout the procedure. The endoscope passed with ease through the anus under direct visualization; it was advanced to the cecum, confirmed by the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve. The scope was withdrawn and the mucosa was carefully examined. The views were good. The patient's toleration of the procedure was good. Retroflexion was performed in the rectum.
A time out was performed before starting the procedure. Cecum was intubated. Cecum was not visualized.
The quality of the preparation was excellent.

INSTRUMENTS:   #2727332 (PC-8)
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:  No
LIMITATIONS:      None  TOLERANCE:   Good  VISUALIZATION:  Good

FINDINGS:
No old blood seen. Scattered polyps (<1CM) seen and not removed. There was an area of mucosal oozing (likely from scope trauma), hemoclip x 1 applied.
Rectum appeared diffusely firable with spontaneous diffuse oozing. Biopsy taken. Not amenable to endosocpic intervention. No retroflexion done.
A small 2mm flat polyp in the ascending colon was removed with cold biopsy forceps. A 6mm polyp in the rectum was removed by cold biopsy forceps.
The prep was fair; vigorous irrigation and suctioning performed. Retroflexion revealed hemorrhoids.
The quality of the colonic preparation was only fair throughout the colon.
Transverse colon: removal of 8-9mm polyp via cold snare polypectomy.
Unable to complete colonoscopy. Blah blah Incomplete colonoscopy.
One 12mm sessile polyp on the appendiceal orifice, biopsied with cold biopsy forceps.
The polyp could not be removed. Resection not attempted.
Incomplete procedure. Colonoscopy was incomplete. The cecum could not be reached.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Small polyp, removed.
2. One large cecal polyp; unable to remove as it was on the appendiceal orifice.
3. Internal hemorrhoids.
4. Fair prep.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Follow-up biopsy results.
